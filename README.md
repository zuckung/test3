This .md-file is generated by a script. It reads the plugin informations out of files located in /res/pluginlist/ , so Pull Request your changes there. Easier, cleaner, faster than editing a long list.

Hecter, you probably want to change this text. You can do that in /res/header.txt .

And when you decide to make this test.md the README.me you have to edit /res/paths.txt on line 'indexfile = ' and start the manual-generate-md-file workflow again. 

If you want some other design on each plugin entry, the bottom of res/src/makemd.py is easy to edit. or tell me what you want.

I have some more plans, still testing.

>Pug Defense is a small but extremely challenging plugin which adds a system to the south of the galaxy, accessible only by jump drive. In the system, corrupted pug fleets will spawn, extremely hostile and after your blood, however, should you be strong enough, you can challenge the planets and demand tribute. The defenders are like nothing you've ever seen before, including the peak of Pug technology, the Pug Perfecta.
>
>To access the plugin content, first land on any planet to initialize the missions. Then go to the Sard system and jump south from there to a new system, Sylansia Lost. From there, landing on Monolith will begin the quest chain.

>"This plugin was made to allow content creators to have access to all outfits in a single place, for the purpose of designing and testing outfit loadouts for new ships. Of course, it can also be used by people who want to ruin the game for themselves by getting a massive fleet without needing to work for it."
>World Forge does this as well, but extends this: not only all outfits in one place, but sorted by race additionally, a way to change the swizzle(derived from ProjectRunabout), a easy way to add own outfits and ships into the existing scheme, and  missions to change your reputation with factions!
