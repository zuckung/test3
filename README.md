This .md-file is generated by a script. It reads the plugin informations out of files located in /res/pluginlist/ , so Pull Request your changes there. Easier, cleaner, faster than editing a long list.

Hecter, you probably want to change this text. You can do that in /res/header.txt .

And when you decide to make this test.md the README.me you have to edit /res/paths.txt on line 'indexfile = ' and start the manual-generate-md-file workflow again. 

If you want some other design on each plugin entry, the bottom of res/src/makemd.py is easy to edit. or tell me what you want.

I have some more plans, still testing.
