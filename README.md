Description:<br>
>This plugin adds a set of Gyroscopes: They can store an amount of energy, and can produce turning force, despite not taking any engine space. But, they are dense, and constantly consume energy.
>
>In addition, there are Flywheel Batteries: similar to the gyroscopes, except that they are dedicated batteries with no turn rate; much more powerful than a similarly sized battery, but with the mentioned downsides.
