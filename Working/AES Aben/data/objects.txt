planet "Nis"

The most dominant species noticeably resemble old earth humans, they boast a very large build and move cautiously in groups when in the wilderness`

planet "Pesek"
	description `A lifeless rock with little in the way of a breathable atmosphere, and no immediate signs of any past civilization.
