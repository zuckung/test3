			`	"Captain <last>, I've been wanting to organize a dinner to discuss business on Greenwater. This operation has been my most profitable venture to date, but I still like to maintain discussions on the future of the enterprise with prospective business partners. I'm currently on <destination>, I will extend my stay and I am looking forward to meeting with you again.`
			`	-Sincerely, David Turner, Turner Incorporated"`
			`	Turner pays you 4000 credits a day, the least you can do is take him up on a company dinner.`

			`You reach Turner in a restaurant of his choice, he is already ordering by the time you arrive and seems enthralled with the label on some bottle of wine after the server leaves his table. He notices as you take your seat opposite him and throws you one of his smirks that show you he's up to something. "Hello again <first>, I hope I haven't taken you from anything too important in your travels." You're not sure where to start if you are to get into what you've been up to.`

			`	"Well your life is out there, just as my place is wherever something in my business needs managing. There's always some fire to put out no matter what success you find in the business." Two plates are delivered to the table just as he finishes that thought, "I took the liberty of ordering you their special, this place is renowned for it."`
				goto "proposition"
			label "expense"
			`	"I'm sure, such dangerous work has its losses, real losses. I prefer the safety that life in civilization affords me, nevertheless, there's something to admire about the path you've carved for yourself." He is about to continue when he is distracted by his plate being delivered to the table, "Ah! The food here is divine, I ordered for us both before you arrived." Another plate arrives after his with some obvious effort in the presentation of the food.`
				goto "proposition"

			`	Somewhat retreated, he hesitates before continuing, "Captain, I see you as a business partner, not for your direct involvement in how business is run, but for the value you offer us when we need you. The prestige you've built around your name during your travels is the talk of the day, simply put, our affiliation with you is a PR boost that justifies your daily stipend all by itself." There was an air of discomfort as he began but he quickly returned to his usual confidence as he seems to have found the words, "I don't have time for much of the noise of personal life, the business all but consumes me. I somehow always catch an ear of the rumors that follow you though, is it true that you've seen beyond Human and Hai territories?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes. There is a lot to discover beyond our reach."`
				`	"Our galaxy isn't so small, there was bound to be more out there."`
			`	"I hope this doesn't land as disappointing but I was hoping you could offer some insight into what opportunities lie out there. You have no doubt seen more out there than any of us are privy to."`

			`	You go over the options in your head, what to reveal to him. The Coalition seems as good a place to start as any, "There is a coalition of species beyond the Free Worlds. They combated with the Quarg long ago and their technology is far beyond our own. There might be an opportunity to import some of their technology under the name of the business." He ponders on that but looks discouraged as he says, "The regulations on that would be a bureaucratic nightmare. The South also brings too much unpredictability, the civil war wasn't too long ago after all. Is there anything else?"`

			`	"North of the Hai there is a species of bird-like nomads, they travel through wormholes to repair broken worlds. Is terraforming a viable business to pursue?" He hesitates momentarily, again, "That's a curious thing to do, and a lot to take in. Terraforming isn't a direction I'm particularly fond of, we also don't have the scale for that level of investment. What else can you tell me?"`
			`	"Well the Unfettered Hai found a way to invade those nomads to the north, the Wanderers. They are fighting back but only so that they have time to retreat through another wormhole, unfortunately, they retreated to a much more dangerous place." Dumbfounded as he is, he finds the words to say, "There truly is a whole live galaxy out there, it's hard to imagine any of this within the confines of our space."`
			label "korath"
			`	You fall into the conversation in clear neglect of each of your meals, you start to explain about the Korath, "Beyond Hai space towards the galactic core there are two warring factions of automated warships. They're still stuck in their original programming to construct more of their drones until they wipe the other out, but they open fire on any foreign ship indiscriminately."`
			`	"This only reinforces my desire to stay in the safety of our territories then, what opportunity would that have afforded us anyway?" he casually inserts with a chuckle between breaths. After a moment you start to continue what you were saying, "There's a trove of salvage out there in even the tamest of their systems. The scrap we could recover could be invaluable to our interests." He seems none too amused with the suggestion, before beginning a short rant on the logistics of preparing for the danger in that region. Not even ignoring the risk it presents to the lives of whoever is sent there to protect the operation. He asks you, "Think bigger picture! How can we reinvent the business and put ourselves on the map?"`
			label "arx"
			choice
				`	"How about relocating the business into free space?"`
				`	"I know of a derelict star cluster you could claim under the business."`
			`	He perks up almost comically as he hears the suggestion, you sit unsure if his response is positive or negative. "<first>, that's brilliant! I planned to operate from an orbital station when I first came into money, the capital needed was still magnitudes more than what was available to me but now, it's a clear next step! We have the infrastructure on the ground already to ensure our funding."`
			`	There's plenty of difficulty in finding a juncture into the conversation, but you decide against it on second thought. His mouth is running so fast you almost expect him to abruptly hit a dead end before long.`
			`	"Captain, I must know what you had in mind!"`
			`	Launching right into it, you go into detail about your recent discoveries beyond the reach of most; the sight of the fantastical megastructure and the few systems beyond.`
			`	As the night goes on it becomes clear that David has plans that he's ruminating on. There's no telling how far he's planned with his 'station' project, having just learned that he's had similar ambitions. It comes time to call it a night and you both end up leaving behind unfinished meals, you shake hands, and he thanks you for your input before you part ways. As you two start to depart, however, David turns to say, "Oh <first>! I almost forgot this wasn't just only a social call, I'll be in touch when I can set aside time for a venture. I'm looking forward to breaking ground on this with you."`

			`David is unable to settle himself while you are landing at the station, he's been pacing around your cockpit for a while now. You two walk in silence through your ship out into the dock, he takes a brief moment to take in the state of his surroundings and lets out a sigh as if he were to hear bad news.`
			`	"What is the situation here <first>? Why did you bring me here instead of some system unknown to most, as you alluded to?" he asks you with a clear frown on his face, uneasing your stance.`
			`	You ask him in response, "Does any of this feel out of place to you?" David takes another brief glimpse of his surrounding with no change in expression, "No, should it? It's just abandoned, I suppose it's odd that the Hai would leave this place unattended, and it's too far to be an old human outpost."`
			`	"It's just an abandoned station, the supports are crumbling, the rooms were pilfered at some point, and pirates had their fun painting the walls at some point." A pause follows your affirmation, you unintentionally leave David confused, before signaling for him to follow you back into your ship. David follows closely behind you to your Quantum Keystone that lies within the stabilizing casing that the Remnant gave to you, while he cautiously approaches and asks various questions regarding what it is and what it does, you do your best to explain in detail your experience with the Keystone's odd behavior relating to this station.`

			`The epitome of bewilderment paints David's face, he's almost in disbelief at what he sees once your ship leaves the port. "We set down with that manipulated Keystone and depart, and now we're somehow somewhere else entirely?" David asks rhetorically. After a silent moment, while you distance the ship from the station, he asks, "Could you obtain more of those devices that allow ships to enter here? I don't want to get ahead of myself but I think this is exactly what the next step for the business looks like."`
			`	With a promise that you'll try to get more, while you intentionally omit your source out of consideration for the Remnant, you'd best set off for the Remnant when you're done here.`

The moss is easily traversable on the surface as below the soft fuzzy exterior, it holds an incredibly tough composition, unable to be broken through without tools.`
