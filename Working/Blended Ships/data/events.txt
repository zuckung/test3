			`As soon as you land, you hear angry murmers all around you from people watching the news. Asking someone to tell you what's going on, you learn that, while you were fighting the Pug, a small engineering firm on Canyon was using looted jump drives in their own project rather than using them to help fight the Pug. This project has finally produced an inane ship which consists of a Splinter welded onto about a third of a Korath raiding vessel. The ship's only redeeming factor is its jump drive, so many of the people around you are very angry over their abuse of this valuable and rare resource.`
