	description "Ever since the Tarazed Falcon was released, starship captains across the galaxy have argued over whether it or the Betelgeuse Leviathan is a better ship. After some arguments got out of hand, Greenrock Shipyards, Ltd. produced a new ship from the parts of the Falcon and Leviathan, complete with a big cannon in the front. Unfortunately, shoving two hulls together tends to produce extra drag, so the Eagle will forever be remembered a comprimise ship: neither fast, nor particularly strong."

	description "The Greenrock Shipyards Rawalpindi is the most heavily armed freighter money can buy. Rumour is that it's even used by some pirates as a raiding ship. It is named after the HMS Rawalpindi, a legendary armed merchant cruiser that was destroyed on Earth more than a thousand years ago. Although naming something after a destroyed ship does not seem like the best business model, you are assured that, since many people struggle to pronounce the name, let along know of its namesake, there is very little impact on its sales."

	description "Recently, the Republic has had increasingly difficult troubles with pirates on the fringes of human space. Rather than increase funding to the Navy, policy makers instead decided to fund a new class of ship, assembled out of Star Queen and Rainmaker parts. The Star General is the result: it is slightly less agile than the Star Queen and has slightly less capacity, but is more heavily armoured and able to easily fend off small numbers of pirates with its impressive array of missile launchers. The Republic uses the Star General as a secure luxury transport, and it is also made available to a handful of individuals that have earned the Republic's trust."

	description "The Woodchip, designed by engineers working on Canyon, is an absolutely horrible ship. Although it is reasonably powerful, it is exorbitantly expensive and painfully slow-moving, and has been considered a crime against humanity because each Woodchip contains a jump drive which could have been used in the war against the Pug. The only redeeming feature of this ship - and its main selling point - is the jump drive at its core, taken along with the rest of the raiding ship that went into making it. After some deliberation, the PR manager of the firm that manufactured these ships demanded that the extra engine lobes get removed, and he got his way before being summarily dismissed the day before the company went bankrupt from legal fees."

	description "While Mereti automata usually progress perfectly fine in their evolution, there are occasionally errors that can compound insanely quickly and produce some very war drones, nothing like the normal progression.
