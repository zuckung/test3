# LEESt contribution guide

This is my plugin, so I do not accept any new missions
or stories from anyone. However, you can suggest new
missions or stories.

Sprites are accepted. If you spot an error in the
plugin, please file an issue and I will fix it as
soon as possible.

- English spelling: Use American English. Organize not
  organise, defense not defence, color not colour. This
  is consistent with vanilla, which uses en-US with a
  few exceptions (like dialog).
