# Graphs
Here is a graph of some of LEEST's storylines. Spoilers ahead, you have been warned.

In the `img` folder you will be able to download the SVG files and the `.drawio` files used to generate the SVG.

## Legend
- Blue text boxes are explanations and are linked to what they explain by a white line.
- Purple-like diamonds are conditions.
- Green rectangles are missions. They are linked to the conditions that they set by arrows.
- Red circles are events.

## GitHub Code Vault storyline
For brevity, the prefix `githubCodeVault.` has been removed from most of the nodes that have it in the original game data.
