# LEEST original files
This directory contains the files used to create LEEST's artwork. For example, the Inkscape SVG files in the `label` folder are the source files for the labels in `images/label`, the files from which Inkscape exported the final PNG for use in Endless Sky.

If ever in the future LEEST gets an original ship, the Blender file will end up here.
