# Introduction

A comprehensive library of ancient and new plugins for the open-source game Endless Sky.

# Download

Scroll down for a list of links and infos to the plugins.

## Downloading Alternative:

Third party tool such as [this](https://download-directory.github.io/) can download a single folder/plugin. Paste the url to the folder url into that tool and you will be given a .zip for that folder.

"For example, for the "50 cal" plugin, enter: [https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/tree/main/Working/All%20Plugins/50%20cal](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/tree/main/Working/All%20Plugins/50%20cal)

Github by default only allows the entire library to be downloaded as a single .zip. Github may have issues with downloading very large file sizes, a possible workaround is using Github Desktop or Git Bash to clone the repository.

## Notes

"Working" directory – plugins updated to work with the continous build of Endless Sky
"Originals" directory – archived copies of original plugins
"Nonfunctional" directory – plugins that will not function without updates

## Known Plugin Issues

Can be found here [here](res/categories/issues.md).
