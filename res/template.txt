# Introduction

A comprehensive library of ancient and new plugins for the open-source game Endless Sky.

# Download

Scroll down for a list of links and infos to the plugins.

## Downloading Alternative:

Third party tool such as [this](https://download-directory.github.io/) can download a single folder/plugin. Paste the url to the folder url into that tool and you will be given a .zip for that folder.

"For example, for the "50 cal" plugin, enter: [https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/tree/main/Working/All%20Plugins/50%20cal](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/tree/main/Working/All%20Plugins/50%20cal)

Github by default only allows the entire library to be downloaded as a single .zip. Github may have issues with downloading very large file sizes, a possible workaround is using Github Desktop or Git Bash to clone the repository.

## Notes

"Working" directory – plugins updated to work with the continous build of Endless Sky
"Originals" directory – archived copies of original plugins
"Nonfunctional" directory – plugins that will not function without updates

## Known Plugin Issues

Can be found [here](res/categories/issues.md).

# Contribution

## Informations

As you may have noticed some plugins miss infos. That ranges from missing author name to full description, or just if it is still playable on the current Endless Sky version. 

Please help updating these, by either posting in discussions area or by a Pull Request changing the files in `/res/pluginlist/`. 
Thanks.

## Add your plugin

You want your plugin here? Fork this repository, upload your plugin and make a Pull Request. Beside that you can post it in the discussion area.

For Pull Requests... the folder structure has changed with this update. There are no more category folders for you to upload to. Instead you create a file with the plugin informations in `/res/pluginlist/`, so this md-file can get auto-generated by a script.
